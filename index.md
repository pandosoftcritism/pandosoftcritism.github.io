## Hi there.

You‚Äôre here probably because you searched Pandosoft on Google or someone sent you the link to this website. Nice. Please keep reading.

Anything in this world will face critism. It's better to expose yourself to both side of the argument, then  make your own choice. I agree that I might spread misinformation, so I advice you to always think critically, cross-check facts before accepting my points. Feel free to join visit their website, social media and chat groups. Some of the points are only a reminder or question you should answer.

## Association With Previous Scams
Thanks to one of the readers, I found out about these. I purposely put this section here becauses some of you might don't feel like reading a lengthy website.

Keywords: Global Force Alliance (GFA), DinarDirham, DDKoin, Prosumer World, Navaratnam Velanadam  
Search any of these keywords with the word "scam" e.g. "DinarDirham scam".

## Purpose
First, I would like to clarify what is the purpose of this text. It‚Äôs simple. I just want to convince you that Pandosoft might be a fraud. To be honest, I admire the goal of the project to revolutionize the internet, but their marketing and operation isn‚Äôt convincing. I don‚Äôt mind the rich being scammed. I just pity those who are not financially comfortable, deceived by misleading advertising made by Pandosoft.

## Already Confident?
Always be skeptical. Always question everything. Yes. Everything. Even your own partner, the nature of reality itself, your family, and your cat.

![cognitive distortions](/img/cognitive-distortions.jpg)  
A bit unrelated, but you get my point.

There is no black and white. It‚Äôs always shades of grey.

## About Me (feel free to skip)
Let me tell about myself a bit. I‚Äôm just a university student. Currently, I‚Äôm taking an engineering course. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself an expert on anything related to Pandosoft ‚Äì blockchain, cryptocurrency, streaming platform and so on. However, I was exposed to the internet at quite an early age. I would say I‚Äôve developed a sense for detecting scams on the internet. I tend to research as much as possible when it comes to lots of things, from something simple such as choosing what apps I should use to keep my notes to something complex as automating a repetitive task. I do invest in some cryptocurrency and reading a bit about it. (Not important) I remember getting bitcoin for free around 2017. Practically cents at that time and got plenty of profits after years. Didn‚Äôt really think of making profits, just thought it looked cool (I was a teenager).

I do believe blockchain will somehow be popular in the future. I don‚Äôt think everything everything could be decentralized, though. Possible, but hard. 

## Red Flags
There are plenty of signs that I consider to be the sign of a scam. Even if it legitimate, better be safe than sorry.

Before I begin, here‚Äôs a video about Zern Tan, a scammer that you might‚Äôve heard of. It‚Äôs quite long, but trust me, it‚Äôs worth watching. Subtitle available.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eqf6H9GhSSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

## Excessive Claims
The idea of a decentralized streaming network is legitimate. I do not deny that. However, they are excessively claiming that it will revolutionize the internet and guaranteed profit in the future. I don‚Äôt think any company should do that. Mentioning it one or two times is fine. They are doing it repetitively. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs bad marketing. Also, if it is really that good, wouldn‚Äôt many other big companies rush to work with Pandosoft? I don‚Äôt see they‚Äôre mentioning any partner or sponsor. I also don‚Äôt think crypto communities in Malaysia even talk much about it. Even if you try to, I bet most of them will doubt because of how Pandosoft handle the whole operation. Too fishy.  <br>
![claim](/img/claim.png)  
![theta investors](/img/theta-inv.png)  
Theta Investors

## Unprofessional/Inconsistent (not sure how to put it).
There‚Äôs another similar project called [Theta](https://www.thetatoken.org/). Before February 2021, they listed Theta as a technology partner. If you check Pandosoft current white paper, it‚Äôs gone, and they changed ‚Äútechnology partner‚Äù to ‚Äútechnology used‚Äù. Sneaky. Theta never had any contact with Pandosoft. Theta‚Äôs Telegram admin group even said that Pandosoft took their images, which a scam site might do. Ouch.  

![chat](/img/image-5.png)  

![chat](/img/image-6.png)  

They don‚Äôt use Theta then, right?  

![chat](/img/image-6a.png)  
Here, Pandosoft said that their blockchain is a hardfork (hardfolk? üòÇ) of Theta. Then, why they removed it? I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre legally* required to credit Theta, but Pandosoft is being suspicious here.

From Googling:
" A hard fork (or hardfork), as it relates to blockchain technology, is a radical change to a network‚Äôs protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice-versa."

Their blockchain being a hardfork of Theta sounds plausible. I found something odd, though.  
![chat](/img/image-7.png)  
Here, a member stated that Pandosoft wanted to build the blockchain from scratch. This message is older than the previous message. So, what‚Äôs going on over here? Is Pandosoft hardfork of Theta or not? Not sure, but again, more inconsistencies.

## Source?
If I recall correctly, Pandosoft are going to make their stuff open source. I guess they will release it later. But why not now? The only reason I could think is that they don‚Äôt want their technology to be copied. Alright, sure. But you‚Äôre going to release it anyway later, and still have chance of being copied. Heck, you‚Äôre hardforking Theta right now and claiming you could be better. What if someone hardfork Pandosoft and come out better? Pandasoft might lose the game. The investors should be aware of this. Investing in a suspicious company could be dangerous. It might be better to invest on popular cryptocurrency such as XRP if you‚Äôre not that knowledgeable about blockchain. If you really want to invest in Pandosoft, assume you will lose your investment. Just in case.

## Staff With Unknown Background
Have you tried searching background of their team members? Not much can be found, which does not inspire confidence. Again, more risk.  
![theta homepage](/img/image-12.png)  
Theta‚Äôs Homepage

At least Theta bothered to include some background info. I guess Pandosoft doesn‚Äôt have much strong points. Sure, Pandosoft is the first* in Asia/Southeast Asia(?) to tackle this technology. It makes sense nobody here has any experience in this area, I guess. Still, they should include more background info.

Then, I couldn't find who exactly is developing the technology. Anonimity is fine - similar to Bitcoin where its creator Satoshi Nakamoto is literaly unknown to this day, but at least he worked closely with the community. Unlike Pandosoft, all of the technical details for Bitcoin are out there for anyone to inspect.  
![btc](/img/bitcoin.png)  

Update: see first point! They are associated with scams.

## FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out
I‚Äôm pretty sure they try to induce the fear of missing out. Did they try to rush you to buy them? Did they say that you will regret the chance to turn your life around?

## Paying To Run Nodes
I‚Äôm not an expert in blockchain technology. But so far I‚Äôve only encountered cryptos with nodes that doesn‚Äôt need you to pay in order to run their nodes. Pandosoft, however, require you to stake your pando token, which is then locked for 6 months. I‚Äôve heard of staking cryptos for months, but I‚Äôm not sure of the former. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better if everyone can run the nodes for free? Theta does that. Odd. Maybe because they are not capable of convincing people to stake voluntarily? I will search for more info and update this.

Update: Ethereum 2.0 uses Proof of Stake. Pandosoft didn't state they use that though.

## Proof Of Network
The white paper doesn‚Äôt mention anything about PON. They do mention it on YouTube and Telegram. From what I understand, they simply reward you by participating in the network while your computer is in sleep mode. From Googling, I found out that it might be possible to be connected to the network while in sleep mode.  
![plug](/img/image-1.png)  
No option for plugged in, though

However, as far as I know, all programs are suspended during sleep mode. How does the network recognize the node? How are they going to recognize multiple nodes?

## Inefficient Use Of Electricity
This problem is faced by any blockchain in general. Specialized servers are always more efficient for distributing content. Consumer laptops? Not so much.

## Consider The Possibilities
Right now, Pandosoft is in testing phase. The source is still not released. Not sure if this is normal*. Worst case scenario ‚Äì everything is fake. Another one ‚Äì the product is real but does not achieve what it claims to be/not successful. Not so bad ‚Äì the product is real, but barely gives you any profit. Good ‚Äì the product is successful. There are definitely more cases that I can‚Äôt think of.

What I‚Äôm afraid of is Pandosoft will keep milking money out of people for a really long time. They might bring the tech into reality (or fake product that looks real) and do the usual scam stuff ‚Äì saying you shouldn‚Äôt quit because you should be committed to change your life, create more fear, create more fake hope, claims and so on. An average person can be very gullible.

## Privacy Policy
There are part of the privacy policy that states about Facebook and Google Analytics. Tried searching part of it and found this. I don‚Äôt know if this part being copied pasted is normal, but I noticed that dreiseitl.com does have analytics related to Google but Pandosoft doesn‚Äôt.

![gtag.js1](/img/image-17.jpg)  
gtag.js present on dreiseitl.com  

![g](/img/image-15.jpg)  
![ublock](/img/image-18.png)  
![ublock2](/img/image-19.png)  
I also can‚Äôt seem to find anything else that is related to analytics. That‚Äôs nice, but LOTS of companies usually love analytics.

Can‚Äôt really make any conclusion here. Just odd.

## Possible Censorship 
![](/img/mj1.png)  
![](/img/mj.png)  
MJ was asking questions in a proper manner. Then he got restricted. That's a bit too much, don't you think?  
![](/img/mj2.png)

## Google Trends
![](/img/trend1.png)  
Thought it was popular worldwide? Seems like only Malaysians are searching for it. Found out about this from one of their ex-Telegram member. There are many people casting doubt on them.


Beyond here are the points that you might consider **weak**. Keep in mind, I‚Äôm just trying to seek points that **discourage confidence** and **sign of a scam**.

## Reading Script
There‚Äôs a video on Pandosoft YouTube channel where the host gives you the definition of open source and hard fork. He basically read the definition found from the internet. Nothing wrong with that, would‚Äôve been better if he describe it using his own words. There‚Äôs also some videos that does not look natural and scripted.  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4wG6aQKqzY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hard-fork/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hard-fork/)

He also mentioned that they used Theta consensus protocol but removed it from the white paper as I mentioned earlier.

## Lazy?
![](/img/image-11.png)  
![](/img/image-10.png)  
These logo are low in quality. The second logo in not transparent. It‚Äôs ugly. Couldn‚Äôt find a better one for your pitch deck? Potential investors might be turned off by that..

I also need to look up more about these stuffs.

## Language
Scammers tend to make spelling and grammar mistakes (there are also scams with good language, though). I would say that every legitimate company will try to avoid this. Too lazy to proofread? First impression is important.

## Video Titles
![](/img/image-13.png)  
I understand you‚Äôre trying to get more views. But these are just.. bad in my taste.

## Failed Attempt To Kick Non-Members (?)
![](/img/image-20.jpg)  
Luckily, most people didn‚Äôt do it and seems like Pandosoft didn‚Äôt really enforce it. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to keep the group open? The more the merrier. Use bots with captcha to deter spam.

## Unreachable Emails
![](/img/br.png)  
![](/img/dpo.png)  
2 of their emails are unreachable.

## Outdated Roadmap 
![](/img/roadmap.png)  
We are approaching the end of 2021 but they have only reached mainnet testing phase.

## Still not convinced?!
Find a few people that is actually expert on blockchain technology. A real one, that perhaps have worked on actual code or worked on actual company like CoinGecko. Or someone that has been involved in similar field. Ask for their opinion.

Feel free to comment and argue(I'm referring the comment section in blogger). I myself don‚Äôt have that much time (I wish I do) to watch all of Pandosoft videos and read thousand of chat messages to understand. I wish there was a wiki created to help people understand more. I am aware of the Zoom calls. I can‚Äôt afford to spend hours on that, unfortunately. ~~I actually haven‚Äôt read the white paper~~ I only have skimmed through the whitepaper. If you can point out my mistakes, please do. Can‚Äôt guarantee I will be convinced, though.

I repeat, my intention is to warn you that this might be a scam and risky. The choice is yours. But we will die anyway, so do whatever you like, LOL!

More points, might elaborate later:

-   They have Pando Token, which from my understanding is a digital currency. Are they permitted by Bank Negara Malaysia(or Suruhanjaya Sekuriti?) to do that? Feel free to try: click [here](https://telelink.bnm.gov.my/) or [here](https://www.sc.com.my/investor-empowerment/lodge-a-complaint).  
-   Their software, Rametron shows computers that aren't connected to the network under 'Peers'. Is that normal? Shouldn't it only show actual computers that is connected to yours, which is actual peers? Same with their blockchain explorer - it shows transactions from Coinbase.  
-   Their privacy policy stated that they use Facebook components but I couldn't fnd any. I tried searching for it using uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger which should show some domains related to Facebook if they are saying the truth.
-   Their Terms of Service (ToS) states that blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Yes, this is true. I hope they remind you of that. Do you know about pump and dump? Someone can accumulate tons of Pando Token, peer pressure people to buy it, drive the token price high, then sell them. Easy money.
-   ToS number 15 states that the have full control over their platform. They can easily kick you out without any notice. I agree some degree of moderaton is required, but it seems like the platform authority is not decentralized, only the content distribution is. I'm not exactly a fan of that. Lots of big tech companies turn kinda evil these day, don't they? Facebook, Google and so on. This is also against the aim in their whitepaper - to avoid manipulation. They community should in control instead of a centralized entity, right? 
-   ToS number 18 states that they can terminate your access to the platform without any refund.
-   ToS number 19: "...shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Singapore." . Not Malaysia? Their headquarter is in Singapore. Tried searching for any media coverage from Singapore, found nothing. If they are really as good as they claim to be, they should be able to attract plenty of investors and media in Singapore, don't you think?  
-   The whitepaper claims to have scaleable infrastructure to handle transactions. I don't understand how they are going to solve that. Do you understand that? Have you compared it to other cryptocurrency? Is it legitimate? Eth 2.0 which claims the same thing.
-   I already said this - they emphasize a lot that you can make money with this. Scams do that a lot. There are also scams that doesn't do that.
-   The management team sometimes blame people for not attending their classes, watching their videos when being questioned, make childish comments and comparison. Great.
-   Already stated - lack of transparency because their source code is not available. I'm pretty sure they use open source projects in their product and Pandosoft are required to publish their source code because of the license. Example: BitTorent Protocol.
-   The whitepaper stated that they prevent nodes from faking viewership by requiring viewer to solve small cryptographics puzzles (Proof of Viewership). What are the small cryptographic puzzles? Does this also mean someone could easily fake viewership?
-   They glorify those who buy the higher tier plan. It's common but I don't think that's nice.
-   The whitepaper states that you could lose your stake as a penalty for being inactive.
-   Who are the actual developer?!
-   The whitepaper stated that they aim to create quantum-resistant cryptography. I wonder how they are going to create that. They said wanted to launch mainnet in April 2021 but it got delayed. Only testnet now (September 2021). Did the developers overestimate their abilities? Too bad there are only midddlemans and the investors actually can't see them directly.
-   You can say I'm lazy for not reading the whitepaper properly, I accept that. How about you? Do you understand everything in the whitepaper? Or did you just trust their sweet words? Don't let other people impress you that easily.
-   They didn't bother to properly display math equations in the whitepaper.
-   The whitepaper does not say anything about Proof of Network and Proof of Engagement.
-   Claims to be global multi-billion dollar project but the nodes are centralized in Asia (a bit ironic).
-   I tried plotting a graph for reputation. I got the negative values. Weird. [Link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f81ylaowa8)
-   They should make written article/wiki because not everyone have good internet to watch the videos and join the video calls.
-   Do you see echo chamber effect in their community?
-   Searching for "theta network" on Google gives 81,300,000 results while "pandosoft" only gives 52,200 results. 52,000 is not even 1% of 81,300,000. Unfair comparison but they said it's a global multibillion project and many people are supporting it. Doesn't look like it.

Doesn't look like anyone in those discussion above are interested. Try inviting them to your WhatsApp, Telegram groups and ask them to watch the videos on YouTube. It's very likely they will be more convinced that this is a fraud.
